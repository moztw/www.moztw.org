	<h3> Piaip's tools to Mozilla Translation</h3>
	<p>
	This page contains program/tools made (or tweaked from other's work)
	by myself to help translating Mozilla (localization).
	<p style='color: red; font-weight: bold;'>
	Since Firefox 1.0PR, the locale structure has changed entirely.
	The old MozillaTranslator cannot keep going anymore, so I've made a
	whole new system named 'MozLCDB' (Mozilla Locale Database).
	</p>
	<p style='color: blue;'>
	Some notes for Firefox 0.9+, Thunderbird 0.7:<br/>
	Recently Firefox/Thunderbird has changed their win32 installer from
	Mozilla SFX to 7zip SFX. That means you CAN NOT use mozip to extract
	the files anymore. What you need now is a <a href="http://www.7zip.org">
	    7zip</a> and read <a href="firefox09.txt"> this note </a> by me.
	Some notes about how to make extension versions of firefox language
	pack is also included in the note.

	    The 'mozip' is a program to create W32 localized builds.<br>
	    <b>This version does not need Cygwin anymore.</b><br>
	    <span style="color: red;">
		Warning: mozip used Windows API that implemented correcly on
		NT based environments, like Windows 2000/XP. If you want to 
		use it on 95/98/ME systems, you're on your own. It is reported
		that on 98/ME, some people cannot compress(update) files.

	    <br>
	    <A href="http://members.madasafish.com/~tyndall/create-installer.html">
	    If you are new to mozip, take a look at this good tutorial by Mark
	    Tyndall. </a> <br/>
	    I've posted its usage on the mailing list (some are
	    archived below), so no more documents here.
	    And do not disturb me for that.<br>
	    P.S.: The mozip is ONLY tested and purposed to run on
	    Windows 2000 platform (now turned into XP Pro since I've got a new
	    Compaq Evo N800v).  If you want to try on Windows 95/98, you are
	    on your own. mozip used system calls to update 'Resource' so
	    you'd better run it on NT series.

	    <dt><a href="mtx/mtx12.jar">Mozilla Translator 4.36 + piaip eXtension (mtX)</a></dt>
	    <dd> <b> Current Version: 1.2 </b><br>
	    <b>This project has been shutdown. And for versions after Firefox 1.0PR,
		    Thunderbird 0.8, Mozilla 1.8, you'd better change to MozLCDB.</b><br/>
	    MtX (MozillaTranslator + eXtension) is my tweaked version from 
	    <a href="http://www.mozillatranslator.org"> MozillaTranslator </a>
	    version4.36.<br> 
	    I don't suggest you using this if you are not very familiar with 
	    Mozilla Localization. You may better try the latest version of
	    original MozillaTranslator (at least 5.02 now) instead.<br>
	    The version number of all MtX are based on which version of
	    Mozilla are they dedicated to. Eg, 'mt099' are developed for
	    Mozilla 0.9.9 and later versions.<hr>
	    Version release notes (what has been changed): 
	    <dl>
	    <dt><a href="mtx/mtx12.jar">mtx12 (1.2)</a></dt><dd>
	    <ol>
		<li>'Import' has been removed since we use almost the same format
                    with MT4.36.</li>
		<li>'Export' has been reduced. Currently only 'Write specified JAR'
                    works. 'Write XPI' has been removed because packing on my own
		    will be better. 'Write all jar' is used to export all jars
		    according to names specified in 'Manage install'.</li>
		<li>The 'contents.rdf' generation has been extremly changed to
                    overcome recently broken localeVersion in chromes. I used
		    regular expression to make it more correct. This is so great.</li>
		<li>Images (help/image) are known not to work. You have to
		    extract and repackage it. </li>
		<li>Too bad my JDK 1.4.1 keeps crashing
		    after running JBuilder on my XP SP1, so I will stop
		    developing new version for a while until some big change
		    forced me to do so.</li>
		<li>Maybe I will stop developing this program since I've
		    found that batch processing the glossary file with Python
		    is much more easier. Recently I use my own python script
		    named 'fixmt.py' to do advanced merge, strip work. With
		    Netscape 7.01 (I started with Moz1.2.1 glossary), it
		    helped me to reduce 3000 untranslated mesages to 13XX
		    untranslated. That really helps. Maybe I will put it here
		    someday.</li>

	    <dt><a href="mtx/mtx099.jar">mtx099 (0.9.9)</a></dt><dd>
	    <ol>
		<li>'localeVersion' has been supported in both generating'contents.rdf'
		    and in UI.</li>
		<li>for installs with name containing 'Region', MtX will automatically
                    treat it as 'region' locale and make necessary changes.</li>
		<li> After update, those original text with only one char will
		    be set as 'keep origin' automatically.</li>

	    As I told, usage of mozip can be fetched from mozilla-l10n

	    <dt><a href="../doc/mt4tut.txt"> Tutorial to Using Mozilla Translator </a></dt>
	    <dd>My tutorial posted on mozilla-l10n mailing list to help using
	    MozillaTranslator 4.36. This is maybe the first tutorial to MT.
	    Some people then made HTML versions, manuals and all kinds of
	    documents for MozillaTranslator, while this is the original.<br>
	    This tutorial is expired since Mozilla Translator has been
	    advanced to 5.* and other documents are better, it's here just
	    for memorial reason. A <A href="../doc/chromeview.png">screenshot </a> 
	    was included in that mail.
