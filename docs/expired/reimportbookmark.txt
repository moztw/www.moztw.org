For those looking for a (semi-painful) way to reimport, do this:

Export your Mozilla bookmarks.  (So you can go back and make sure you got
everything.)

Rname your "Mozilla" folder off somewhere, for me this was C:\Documents and
Settings\ryan\Application Data\Mozilla - I renamed it "Mozilla.old"

Uninstall Mozilla.

Install RC1.

Export your bookmarks.

Rename the *new* Mozilla folder out of the way.  ("Mozilla.rc1" makes sense.)

Rename your old one back. ("Mozilla.old" -> "Mozilla")

Go in, manage your bookmarks, import the bookmarks you exported 3 steps ago,
edit  for a while to merge the lists.
