NOTE:

/firefox/download/downloadurl.txt should be a single line of url WITHOUT trailing line break,
which means you should NOT edit it with {vim}.

A safe thing to do is to use {echo -n}, e.g.,

 $ echo -n https://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-3.0.6\&amp;lang=zh-TW > downloadurl.txt

then there will be no line breaks in the file.
 
Also please don't forget to change /inc/dlff.html,
we cannot conbine two files coz lighttpd shtml does not support nested includes.
